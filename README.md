## Android theme for jQTouch

This is a very very rudimentary start to create a theme for jQTouch that gives a more native Android look than the standard jQTouch theme.

It's based on the default theme with some tweaks. 

I created it for an app, and it only has styles currently for the elements I was using in that app, so it is certainly incomplete.

It also assumes you won't be using some UI elements that make no sense in Android (such as buttons in the toolbar, etc).

It is also based on the older image-based themes, not the new compass themes.

Please feel free to fork this and make it better. Pull requests will be warmly welcomed.
